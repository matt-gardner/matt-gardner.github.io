      AllenNLP is a toolkit for doing NLP research.  It is built on top of pytorch.  See <a href="https://allennlp.org">allennlp.org</a>
      for more information.

        The path ranking algorithm (PRA) and subgraph feature extraction (SFE) are algorithms that extract feature matrices
        from graphs.  This git repository contains code implementating these two algorithms, produces matrices that are useful
        in a variety of situations.  The repository also contains code for running experiments doing link prediction in a
        graph using these feature matrices (also known as knowledge base completion, when the graph corresponds to a knowledge
        base such as Freebase or NELL).
