    I am a senior research scientist at the <a href="http://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI2).  Before that I
    was a PhD student with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/">Tom Mitchell</a> at the <a href="http://lti.cs.cmu.edu/">Language
      Technologies Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.

    At AI2, I am on the <a href="https://allennlp.org">AllenNLP team</a>.  My research focuses primarily on getting computers to read and
    answer questions, dealing both with open domain reading comprehension and with understanding question semantics in terms of some formal
    grounding (semantic parsing).  I'm particularly interested in cases where these two problems intersect, doing some kind of reasoning
    over open domain text.

    I am the original author of the <a href="https://github.com/allenai/allennlp">AllenNLP toolkit</a>, and I co-host the
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nlp-highlights">NLP Highlights podcast</a> with <a href="/team/waleeda/">Waleed Ammar</a>.

    Back in the day, I spent a lot of time working on knowledge base completion (KBC).  Much of my thesis was exploring the connection
    between graph-based and embedding-based methods for KBC.  I have <a href="http://github.com/matt-gardner/pra">code on github</a> that
    implements a few (rather dated by now) KBC methods.

    Outside of work, I enjoy playing harp and flute duets with my wife (with me on the flute, her on the harp), spending time with my three
    kids, and playing ultimate frisbee and soccer.
